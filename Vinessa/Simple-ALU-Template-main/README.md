# Simple-ALU-Template

Working repository for the Simple ALU project.

The Project One doc has the description of the project along with some sample testing opcodes for the simple ALU.  Make sure you test others on your own.
Document your verilog and your testbench code well!

You must have separate ALU and Testbench files for yor ALU.  Always keep the testing and testbench independent from the design code.
